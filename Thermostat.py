#
# Thermostat - This is the Python code used to demonstrate
# the functionality of the thermostat that we have prototyped throughout
# the course. 
#
# This code works with the test circuit that was built for module 7.
#
# Functionality:
#
# The thermostat has three states: off, heat, cool
#
# The lights will represent the state that the thermostat is in.
#
# If the thermostat is set to off, the lights will both be off.
#
# If the thermostat is set to heat, the Red LED will be fading in 
# and out if the current temperature is blow the set temperature;
# otherwise, the Red LED will be on solid.
#
# If the thermostat is set to cool, the Blue LED will be fading in 
# and out if the current temperature is above the set temperature;
# otherwise, the Blue LED will be on solid.
#
# One button will cycle through the three states of the thermostat.
#
# One button will raise the setpoint by a degree.
#
# One button will lower the setpoint by a degree.
#
# The LCD display will display the date and time on one line and
# alternate the second line between the current temperature and 
# the state of the thermostat along with its set temperature.
#
# The Thermostat will send a status update to the TemperatureServer
# over the serial port every 30 seconds in a comma delimited string
# including the state of the thermostat, the current temperature
# in degrees Fahrenheit, and the setpoint of the thermostat.

## Import necessary to provide timing in the main loop
##
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime

##
## Imports required to allow us to build a fully functional state machine
##
from statemachine import StateMachine, State

##
## Imports necessary to provide connectivity to the 
## thermostat sensor and the I2C bus
##
import board
import adafruit_ahtx0

##
## These are the packages that we need to pull in so that we can work
## with the GPIO interface on the Raspberry Pi board and work with
## the 16x2 LCD display
##
# import board - already imported for I2C connectivity
import digitalio
import adafruit_character_lcd.character_lcd as characterlcd

## This imports the Python serial package to handle communications over the
## Raspberry Pi's serial port. 
import serial

##
## Imports required to handle our Button, and our PWMLED devices
##
from gpiozero import Button, PWMLED

##
## This package is necessary so that we can delegate the blinking
## lights to their own thread so that more work can be done at the
## same time
##
from threading import Thread

##
## This is needed to get coherent matching of temperatures.
##
from math import floor

##
## DEBUG flag - boolean value to indicate whether or not to print 
## status messages on the console of the program
## 
DEBUG = True

##
## Create an I2C instance so that we can communicate with
## devices on the I2C bus.
##
i2c = board.I2C()

##
## Initialize our Temperature and Humidity sensor
##
thSensor = adafruit_ahtx0.AHTx0(i2c)

##
## Initialize our serial connection
##
## Because we imported the entire package instead of just importing Serial and
## some of the other flags from the serial package, we need to reference those
## objects with dot notation.
##
## e.g. ser = serial.Serial
##
ser = serial.Serial(
        port='/dev/ttyS0', # This would be /dev/ttyAM0 prior to Raspberry Pi 3
        baudrate = 115200, # This sets the speed of the serial interface in
                           # bits/second
        parity=serial.PARITY_NONE,      # Disable parity
        stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE,   # Serial protocol will use one stop bit
        bytesize=serial.EIGHTBITS,      # We are using 8-bit bytes 
        timeout=1          # Configure a 1-second timeout
)
