## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The final project was creating a thermostat. It included a module to detect the temperature, 3 buttons (one to change cooling/heating, increase the temperature, and decrease the temperature), and an LCD screen to show the temperature and time. The problem I was solving was how we can you controls and sensors to control something outside of the device, like the A/C. It also worked through using serialization to communicate to the user through an LCD screen on a Raspberrypi.
## What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I excelled at the software. Software is my best skill and I know how to make it concise and efficient. I implemented a solution that would get the job done without adding extra stress or lag to the system.
## Where could you improve?
I could definitely improve in the hardware sector. I had to follow the instructions to the "T" and I still don't completely understand how and why everything works on it. However, I did follow the instructions and worked hard to create a polished product. Overall, I think it ended up very good, but I could definitely improve my skills in that area.
## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The tools and skills I gained in this class and project definitely revolve around the Raspberrypi. I had never worked with Raspberrypi before and now I know how to set it up and get it working with a program. I think this can be very helpful and opens up a whole new area of careers to look at.
## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think the debugging skills are very transferable. I would add print statements so that I could see what was happening in the background on the command line. That way if something wasn't happening on the hardware, I could see where the issue may be occurring. This can be used with any app and is very useful to pinpoint where problems are occurring. I currently use this at my current job to detect bugs and fix them in javascript.
## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This whole thermostat project and code was written in functions. If we need to change anything, we can change the logic in a single place. That way it is easy to understand what the logic should be doing where.
